MFA Delete
	This is an additional layer of security IF we DON'T have S3 Versioning
	Because it's a pemanent deletion
	
	Suspend Versioning must be authenticated by MFA
	
	This option only can be turned on/of by the owner.
	
	To use MFA Delete, Versioning must be swithced on
	
	Talán csak CLI-ből lehet engedélyezni? Ez nem biztos.
