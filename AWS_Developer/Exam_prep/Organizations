An AWS Organization is a feature of AWS that allows you to centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts within your organization. 
With AWS Organizations, you can consolidate billing, control access to AWS services and resources, apply policies across accounts, and automate account management tasks.
It provides a hierarchical structure for organizing and managing accounts, with support for multi-account strategies such as multi-tenancy, workload isolation, and security boundaries.

Key features and benefits of AWS Organizations:

	Consolidated Billing: AWS Organizations enables you to consolidate billing across multiple AWS accounts, making it easier to track costs and allocate expenses. 
	You can have a single payer account that covers the charges for all linked accounts, simplifying financial management.

	Centralized Governance: You can apply organizational policies and controls to enforce security, compliance, and operational standards across all accounts in your organization. 
	This includes IAM policies, Service Control Policies (SCPs), and tagging policies to manage access, resource usage, and compliance requirements.

	Account Management: AWS Organizations provides tools for automating account creation, management, and removal. 
	You can create new accounts programmatically using AWS APIs or AWS CloudFormation templates, and apply predefined configurations and policies to newly created accounts.

	Hierarchical Structure: You can organize your AWS accounts into a hierarchical structure known as an organizational unit (OU). 
	OUs allow you to group accounts based on different criteria such as business units, departments, applications, or environments. 
	This provides flexibility in managing resources and applying policies at different levels of your organization.

	Cross-Account Resource Sharing: AWS Organizations facilitates resource sharing and collaboration across accounts by enabling cross-account access and resource sharing. 
	You can share resources such as Amazon S3 buckets, AWS Lambda functions, and Amazon RDS databases securely across accounts within your organization.
