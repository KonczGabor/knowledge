The CLI will look for credentials in this order

	1, Command line options – --region, --output, and --profile
	
	2, Environment variables – AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
	
	3, CLI credentials file –aws configure
		~/.aws/credentials on Linux / Mac & C:\Users\user\.aws\credentials on Windows
		
	4, CLI configuration file – aws configure
		~/.aws/config on Linux / macOS & C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\config on Windows
		
	5, Container credentials – for ECS tasks
	
	6, Instance profile credentials – for EC2 Instance Profiles
	
	
	
	
-region parameter: If the region parameter is not set, then the CLI command is executed against the default AWS region.vim	
	
	
The --dry-run option checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. 
If you have the required permissions, the error response is DryRunOperation, otherwise, it is UnauthorizedOperation.
