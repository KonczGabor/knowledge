AWS CloudFormation and AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) are both AWS services designed to manage infrastructure as code, allowing you to define and provision AWS infrastructure using configuration files.
While they share some similarities, there are key differences in their focus and capabilities.

AWS CloudFormation:

	is a comprehensive service that allows you to manage almost any AWS resource. It provides a common language for you to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment.

	Scope: CloudFormation supports a wide range of AWS services and resources, making it suitable for managing complex applications that involve multiple types of resources.

	Templates: CloudFormation templates can be written in JSON or YAML. These templates define the AWS resources and their relationships so that you can manage your infrastructure as a single unit.

	Capabilities: It includes detailed control over resource creation, updates, and deletion. It also supports nested stacks, which allow for more complex deployments by referencing other templates.



AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model):
	is an extension of AWS CloudFormation designed specifically for simplifying the creation, management, and deployment of serverless applications on AWS. 
	It provides shorthand syntax to express functions, APIs, databases, and event source mappings.

	Focus: SAM is focused exclusively on serverless resources, such as AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, and other services that are commonly used in serverless architectures.
	

	Templates: SAM templates are an extension of CloudFormation syntax and offer additional simplicity and succinctness for defining serverless resources. These can also be written in YAML or JSON.

	Deployment: SAM provides built-in commands through the SAM CLI (Command Line Interface) that simplify building your application, local testing, and deployments.



Key Differences:

	Specificity vs. Generality:

		CloudFormation is a generic tool that can manage a broad array of AWS services and resources.
		
		SAM is specialized for serverless applications, providing features and shortcuts that are specifically useful for the serverless architecture.
	
	
	Template Syntax:

		CloudFormation uses a more verbose syntax which can describe any AWS resource.

		SAM templates are syntactically simpler when it comes to defining serverless resources, reducing boilerplate code required to define a Lambda function, API Gateway, etc.
	
	
	Tooling:

		CloudFormation integrates with other AWS services and can be used through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.
		
		SAM has the SAM CLI, which adds additional commands specifically for serverless applications, such as sam build, sam deploy, and sam local for local testing.


	Deployment Capabilities:

		CloudFormation requires manual setup of deployment pipelines or integration with AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD.


		SAM integrates more seamlessly with serverless CI/CD practices and simplifies the deployment process for serverless applications 
		with commands directly targeting common serverless development tasks.


Conclusion:

	If your projects are centered around serverless applications, AWS SAM is likely the better choice due to its specialized nature and simplified syntax. 
	If you need to manage a diverse set of resources or a more complex infrastructure, AWS CloudFormation provides the necessary capabilities and flexibility. 
	It's also worth noting that you can use SAM and CloudFormation together in the same project, leveraging SAM for the serverless components while managing other resources with CloudFormation.
