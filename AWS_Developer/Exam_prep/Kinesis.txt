Kinesis: (A az Apache Kafka alternatívája)
 	Valós idejú adat(video, adat stream) gyűjtő, feldolgozó, transzformáló, tároló (alapból 24h, max 365 nap) és analizáló(machine learning) service brutál sávszéllel, valós időben (on-the-fly).
	Store, encrypt, index data
	Serverless
	Csak FIFO
	Nem ingyenes, de csak annyit fizetünk amennyit használjuk.
	Shard: Egyértelműen azonosított adatok sorozata(sequence) egy streamen. Gyakorlatilag az adatfolyam egy blokkja.
		Egy vagy több shard alkot egy stream-et
		
	Maximum Read:
		1MB/sec
	Maximum Write:
		2MB/sec		
		
	Enhanced fan-out: Opcioális feature a Data Stream-el számára, ami 2MB/sec átviteli sebességet biztosít a consumerek és a shardok közt. Ezzel a párhuzomos feldolgozást tudjuk növelni.	
		
	Partition key:
		Ez a kulcs határozza meg h mely adatok tartoznak egy shardba
		one mebibyte limit	
	
	These particular use cases all came from there's an Amazon frequently asked questions, document that talks about Kinesis versus SQS. 
	And these are some of the examples that they gave. So Kinesis give you FIFO order of data that is received, and if you want to maintain the order of log files, Kinesis is the way to go. 
	SQS FIFO could do it as well, now. Next up, ability for multiple applications to consume the same stream concurrently. 
	That is something you cannot do in SQS. You have one conusmer, it receives a message, visibility time-out triggers, and it's invisible to other applications. 
	With Kinesis you can have 2 consumers of the same data at the same time, so that's another good example. Also the ability to consume data many hours later. 
	Kinesis can store data so you can retrieve that later.
	
	Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively scalable and durable real-time data streaming service. 
	KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, database event streams, 
	financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events. 
	The data collected is available in milliseconds to enable real-time analytics use cases such as real-time dashboards, real-time anomaly detection, dynamic pricing, and more.

	Kinesis Data Streams enables real-time processing of streaming big data. 
	It provides ordering of records, as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order to multiple Amazon Kinesis Applications. 
	The Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL) delivers all records for a given partition key to the same record processor, making it easier to build multiple applications 
	reading from the same Amazon Kinesis data stream (for example, to perform counting, aggregation, and filtering).
	
	The capacity limits of an Amazon Kinesis data stream are defined by the number of shards within the data stream. 
	The limits can be exceeded by either data throughput or the number of PUT records. 
	While the capacity limits are exceeded, the put data call will be rejected with a ProvisionedThroughputExceeded exception.

	SQS és Kinesis közt az a különbség h Kinesis esetén garantált h a feldolgozó mindig ugyanaz az adott Consumer lesz.
	Kinesis ugyanazt a producert tudja concurrent processzálni. SQS FIFO szerint a Visibility Timeout kizárólagosságot biztosít egy comsumer számára.

Kinesis Data Analytics:
	Analyze data streams with SQL.
	Realt time dashboard and metrics.	
	
	
	
Firehose:

	General aim: transformation (általában Lambda áll a háttérben) and provide batch output at near real time.
	
	Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. 
	It can capture, transform, and load streaming data into Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk, 
	enabling near real-time analytics with existing business intelligence tools and dashboards you’re already using today. 
	It is a fully managed service that automatically scales to match the throughput of your data and requires no ongoing administration.
		
	Auto scale,
	
	Csak az átmenő adat után fizetünk.

DataStreams VS Firehose:

	Amazon Kinesis Data Streams:
	
		Kinesis Data Streams is a service for real-time processing of streaming data at scale.
		It allows you to build custom applications that can continuously ingest, process, and analyze streaming data in real time.
		With Data Streams, you have more control over the data processing pipeline. You can build custom applications or use pre-built applications to process and analyze the data.
		It is highly scalable, allowing you to handle large volumes of streaming data with ease.
		You can integrate Kinesis Data Streams with other AWS services such as Lambda, Kinesis Data Analytics, and Kinesis Data Firehose for further processing or storage.


	Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose:
	
		Kinesis Data Firehose is a service for loading streaming data into data lakes, data stores, and analytics services.
		It is designed to simplify the process of ingesting streaming data and delivering it reliably to destinations such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, 
		Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Splunk, among others.
		With Firehose, you don't need to write custom applications for data processing. 
		Instead, you configure Firehose to automatically deliver data to the desired destination with options for data transformation and compression.
		Firehose is fully managed, meaning AWS takes care of scaling, monitoring, and managing the infrastructure for you.
		It is suitable for use cases where you need to reliably ingest streaming data into data stores or analytics services without worrying about infrastructure management.


	In summary, if you need fine-grained control over your streaming data processing pipeline and want to build custom applications for real-time analytics, 
	Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is the preferred choice. 
	On the other hand, if you need a managed service to reliably ingest streaming data into data stores or analytics services without managing infrastructure, Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a better fit.

	
	
MSK: (Managed Service Kafka)
	To stream data.
	Serverless.
	Multi AZ (3ig)
	Az edatot EBS-en tárolja, ameddig tartjuk ameddig csak szeretnénk.

	Egy MSK Clusterben élnek a Brokerek. 
	Brokers manage the storage and replication of records, producers publish records to Kafka topics, and consumers subscribe to topics and process records. 
	Together, these components form the backbone of the Kafka messaging system, enabling real-time data processing and stream processing at scale.
		Honnan jöhetnek az adatok, ki lehet Producer?

		A Producerek a Topicra írnak, amik a brokerek közt replikálva vannak	

	

The AWS Kinesis Agent:
	is a standalone Java software application that offers an efficient and reliable way to load data into AWS Kinesis services, including Kinesis Streams, Kinesis Firehose, and Kinesis Analytics. 
	It is designed to simplify the process of collecting, processing, and streaming data in real time. 
	
	Data Collection: Kinesis Agent can monitor log files and automatically load new data as it's written to the logs. 
	It's commonly used to collect data like web server logs, application logs, and other time-variant data.

	Data Processing: Before sending data to AWS Kinesis, the agent can preprocess the data. 
	This preprocessing can include tasks like adding metadata, transforming formats, filtering, and appending newline characters if necessary.

	Data Streaming: After processing, the agent streams this data to the configured AWS Kinesis service. 
	This real-time streaming capability is crucial for applications that require immediate data processing and analysis.
