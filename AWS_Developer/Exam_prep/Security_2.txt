SSE-S3:

	Using Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3), each object is encrypted with a unique key employing strong multi-factor encryption. 
	As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates. 
	Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data.
	
	
	
	
SSE-C:
	You manage the encryption keys and Amazon S3 manages the encryption as it writes to disks and decryption when you access your objects.






Client-Side Encryption: 
	
	You can encrypt data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools.	
	
	
	
SSE-KMS: 

	Similar to SSE-S3 and also provides you with an audit trail of when your key was used and by whom. Additionally, you have the option to create and manage encryption keys yourself.
