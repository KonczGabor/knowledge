 AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is the preferred tool to provision, manage, and deploy server certificates.
 With ACM you can request a certificate or deploy an existing ACM or external certificate to AWS resources.
 Certificates provided by ACM are free and automatically renew. In a supported Region, you can use ACM to manage server certificates from the console or programmatically.

 IAM is used as a certificate manager only when you must support HTTPS connections in a Region that is not supported by ACM.
 IAM securely encrypts your private keys and stores the encrypted version in IAM SSL certificate storage.
 IAM supports deploying server certificates in all Regions, but you must obtain your certificate from an external provider for use with AWS.
 You cannot upload an ACM certificate to IAM. Additionally, you cannot manage your certificates from the IAM Console.
